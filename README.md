## 🎉 New Model Release

 - **2026-02-07**: We are excited to present [[IntelliFold 2]](assets/Intellifold_v2_release_note.pdf). This version represents a
major architectural update and is one of the first open-source models to outperform AlphaFold3 on
Foldbench.  


## 📊 Benchmarking
To comprehensively evaluate the performance of IntelliFold 2, we conducted a rigorous evaluation on [FoldBench](https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/FoldBench). We compared IntelliFold against several leading methods, including [Boltz-1,2](https://github.com/jwohlwend/boltz), [Chai-1](https://github.com/chaidiscovery/chai-lab), [Protenix](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix) and [Alphafold3](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3).

For more details on the benchmarking process and results, please refer to our release note [IntelliFold 2 Release Note](assets/Intellifold_v2_release_note.pdf) and [IntelliFold Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02025).

![Benchmark Metrics](assets/Intellifold_v2_performance.png)


## 🚀 Quick Start

To quickly get started with IntelliFold, you can use the following commands:
```bash
# Install intellifold from PyPI
pip install intellifold
# Run inference with an example YAML file
intellifold predict ./examples/5S8I_A.yaml --out_dir ./output
```

## ⚙️ Installation

To more complete installation instructions and usage, please refer to the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).


## 🔍 Inference

1. **Prepare Input File**: Create a YAML file with your sequences following our [input format specification](docs/input_yaml_format.md)

2. **Run Prediction**:
   ```bash
   intellifold predict your_input.yaml --out_dir ./results
   ```

    IntelliFold v2-Flash will be used by default, you can also use IntelliFold v2 by specifying the model name:
    ```bash
    intellifold predict your_input.yaml --out_dir ./results --model v2
    ```

3. **Check Results**: Find predicted structures and confidence scores in the output directory, you can also check the section of **output format** in [output documentation](docs/input_yaml_format.md#output-format).

4. **Optional Optimization**: Enable [custom kernels](docs/kernels.md) for faster inference and reduced memory usage

For comprehensive usage instructions and examples, refer to the [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md).


## 🌐 IntelliFold Server

**We highly recommend using the [IntelliFold Server](https://server.intfold.com) for the most accurate, complete, and convenient biomolecular structure predictions.** It requires no installation and provides an intuitive web interface to submit your sequences and visualize results directly in your browser. The server runs the **full, optimized, latest** IntelliFold implementation for optimal performance.
